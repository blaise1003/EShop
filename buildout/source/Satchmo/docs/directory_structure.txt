Directory Structure
===================

Before proceeding too far with the Satchmo installation process, it is
useful to get a basic understanding of the way Satchmo is laid out.

The base Satchmo directory should look like this::

    |-- docs
    `-- satchmo
        |-- apps
        |-- projects
        `-- static


The docs directory contains the text documents that can be used with `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ to create nicely formatted
html or pdf documentation.

To understand the Satchmo template structure, please refer to :ref:`Template Customization <template-customization>`.

Satchmo Apps
------------

The core Satchmo application is included in the apps directory and is laid out like this::

    apps
    |-- l10n
    |-- payment
    |-- product
    |-- satchmo_ext
    |-- satchmo_store
    |-- satchmo_utils
    |-- shipping
    `-- tax


The directories are created in this fashion so that we can accomplish a couple of goals:

    1. Decouple portions of Satchmo so that others may use and improve upon them
    2. Bundle the required portions together so that installation is as simple as possible
    3. Allow store owners flexibility in installing only the portions they need
    4. Allow developers to extend Satchmo to provide the custom portions they require

Here's a brief description of the various applications.

    **l10n (required)**
        A collection of models and data used to Internationalize Satchmo. This data
        includes all of the country information as well as tools to present information
        correctly depending on the user's location.

    **payment (required)**
        The various payment modules, forms and views used to allow checking out of a store.

    **product (required)**
        The models and views used to store and present product information

    **satchmo_ext (optional)**
        A collection of Satchmo modules that provide optional features that may or may not
        be needed for your store. Additional information on these are described below.

    **satchmo_store (required)**
        The core models, views and urls used for a store. This application includes account
        information, contact information and the base tools for running a store.

    **satchmo_utils (required)**
        A collection of helper utilities used throughout Satchmo.

    **shipping (required)**
        The various modules used to determine shipping costs for orders.

    **tax (optional)**
        Modules for calculating tax based on various criteria.


Satchmo_ext
^^^^^^^^^^^

As described above, the satchmo_ext module includes many smaller applications that you
may wish to include in your site.

    **brand**
        This application is useful if you have different brands of products that you want to use to
        categorize and display your products.

    **newsletter**
        Satchmo has two basic options for handling newsletter configurations. You can use a simple
        database list or interface with mailman. See :ref:`newsletter`.

    **product_feeds**
        Provides support for atom or csv feeds of the products in the store. For more info on using
        with Google base, see :ref:`feeds`.

    **productratings**
        Product ratings allows your store users to rate and review the products in the store.

    **recentlist**
        Allows you to display recently viewed products on your site.

    **tieredpricing**
        This application provides improved flexibility for charging different prices
        to different customers. It is useful for membership or other tiered price structures. See :ref:`tieredpricing`.

    **upsell**
        Present options to customers to purchase other items based on their current items. See :ref:`upsell`

    **wishlist**
        The wishlist allows shoppers to add items from the store to a list that they might
        want to purchase from in the future.

.. _satchmo_sample_projects:

Satchmo Projects
----------------

This directory contains an example project that illustrate how to layout Satchmo and integrate it with other
Django applications. The installation process will discuss how to setup your individual application based on
this sample. The simple project includes a sample database and can be run directly to provide
a quick example of a Satchmo store.

Simple
^^^^^^

This is a very basic example of a "simple" Satchmo store.

It should work right from checkout.  Start it with "./manage.py runserver" and browse to http://localhost:8000/

Admin is:

Username: admin
Password: simple

Skeleton
^^^^^^^^

This directory includes the absolute basic files needed to get Satchmo working. It is not a standalone working version
but is meant to be used as a template for your store. It is used by the clonesatchmo program to setup your store.

Satchmo Static
--------------

The static directory contains all of the css, javascript and image files used in Satchmo. This directory is meant
to be copied to your local Satchmo store. Once your store is running this directory will contain your product images
as well as custom css and javascript. The process for setting this up will be covered in the installation guide.
